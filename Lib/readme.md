# Hardware Libraries

In order to have Arduino recognize the hardware libraries, please run "Symbolic_Link_Generator.bat" and enter path to the Arduino libraries (C:\Users\USER\Documents\Arduino\libraries).
If there are any changes made to these libraries, you will have to manually re-copy and paste them back into the same folder.
