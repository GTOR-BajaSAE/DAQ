# Hardware Libraries

In order to have Arduino recognize the hardware libraries, please copy and paste the contents of this folder into C:\Users\USER\Documents\Arduino\libraries .
If there are any changes made to these libraries, you will have to manually re-copy and paste them back into the same folder.
